# Assignment1
This is Assignment 1 for BioVis. 

In this assingment I created shapes. I created a yellow rectange with initial location. A circle with a different cordinate on the grid, I added the color red too.. A line with a certain position with a different stroke width. Finally, a Polygon with a blue filling and a red outline. 
These are the links I used for a guide in creating the shapes:

Design Technically, after watching the youtube video I understood how to make the shapes, but Polygon wise, I didn't know what were the attributes for the shape. It took me a while to understand the polygon, because unlike the other shapes, it included the "points" which confuced me on how to place them in the code. I don't know much of javascript, but after further looking, I understood why the points matter and how to place the polygon as a whole. I was very happy with my result.

Design Achievements, I was proud of the filling on the shape in the polygon, I was able to do an outside line of and a fill, which I haven;t done to other shapes, it was different than any other.
